            down to 100, giving Null Island company. Display column has been removed, Name
            column added with shorter version of the old Display name. Name_Long contains

            in question was the part of Rhode Island that lies on the mainland, just east 
            of the Sakonnet River and the city of Newport, and just south of Fall 
            River, MA.
- CHANGED:  All US state boundary fixes: R.I.-Mass., Va.-N.C. now bends south in the

            Modify the DC shape a bit to better match more detailed zooms and remove part
            of the adm-1 line on the shore.
- CHANGED:  The ADM1NAME Ãstfold corrected to Østfold.
- CHANGED:  Zhejiang – Should be labeled as the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Is part of
            Australia. RENAMED Niue – Is not part of Australia, but independent. 
            Associated with New Zealand. DELETED as admin-1 units are not shown for small
            countries. Kerguelen Islands are part of France DELETED as admin-1 units are
            not shown for small countries.
- CHANGED:  Niassa Province in Mozambique is incorrectly spelled as ‘Nassa’. ‘Niassa’ is
            there as a varname, but the province has never been called ‘Nassa’.
- CHANGED:  Populated places (10m, 50m and 110m) - Norwegian cities, in whole related to
            the special characters æ, ø and å. The following corrections should be made: 
            Baerum -> Bærum, Svolvaer -> Svolvær, Tonsberg -> Tønsberg and 
            Vadso -> Vadsø.
- CHANGED:  Baguio City in the Philippines is still the defacto summer location of the 
            supreme court (judiciary branch of government), a similar situation as Chile
            and a couple other countries, but is now coded as “Admin-0 cap alt”. However, 
            Quezon City and Pasay City are downgraded from Admin-0 capital alt to 
            “Populated place” as the recent constitution states that the entire admin-1 
            unit of Manila is the national capital and they fall inside that feature. 
- CHANGED:  The place name Wiener Neustadt in Austria (that is the proper name of the 
            city) had the wrong NAME attribute “Wiener”.
- CHANGED:  Across the Mekong from Nakhon Phanom (Thailand), Natural Earth has a 
            settlement marked “Khammouan” in Laos. Khammouan(e) is the name of a province.
            The actual city across the river appears to be the capital of said province,
            Thakhek.
- CHANGED:  San Carlos moved east out of Lake Nicaragua.
- CHANGED:  Primarily in Iran, Egypt, and Lebanon. “Name in NEV” >> “Should be”: 
            Dayr az Zawr >> Dayr az Azwr, Khoramabad >> Khorramabad, 
            Shahr E Kord >> Shar e Kord, Zagizig >> Zagazig, Damanhr >> Damanhur, 
            Nabatiyet et Tahta >> Nabatiye et Tahta
- CHANGED:  Greeneville, NC should be Greenville, NC
- CHANGED:  Two point features labeled Bayankhongor in Mongolia. Kept the ’southern’ 
            point, delete the northern one. Southern feature featureType changed to 
            “Admin-1 cap”.
