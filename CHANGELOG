GENERAL
- NATURAL_EARTH_UPDATE_2.0.0	**UPDATED**All instances of Name1 have been changed to name, NAME to name, Name2 to name_alt. Vertexes were added to many themes to allow them to project into conics smoothly. All field (column) names are now lowercase and generally in the order of: scalerank, featurecla, name, name_alt, natscale, labelrank, *. Scale ranks in filenames now scale rank (singular). All files now include VERSION and README files. Full changes detailed by file below.

            the special characters æ, ø and å. The following corrections should be made: 
            Baerum -> Bærum, Svolvaer -> Svolvær, Tonsberg -> Tønsberg and 
            Vadso -> Vadsø.
- CHANGED:  Baguio City in the Philippines is still the defacto summer location of the 
            supreme court (judiciary branch of government), a similar situation as Chile
            and a couple other countries, but is now coded as “Admin-0 cap alt”. However, 
            Quezon City and Pasay City are downgraded from Admin-0 capital alt to 
            “Populated place” as the recent constitution states that the entire admin-1 
            unit of Manila is the national capital and they fall inside that feature. 
- CHANGED:  The place name Wiener Neustadt in Austria (that is the proper name of the 
            city) had the wrong NAME attribute “Wiener”.
- CHANGED:  Across the Mekong from Nakhon Phanom (Thailand), Natural Earth has a 
            settlement marked “Khammouan” in Laos. Khammouan(e) is the name of a province.
            The actual city across the river appears to be the capital of said province,
            Thakhek.
- CHANGED:  San Carlos moved east out of Lake Nicaragua.
- CHANGED:  Primarily in Iran, Egypt, and Lebanon. “Name in NEV” >> “Should be”: 
            Dayr az Zawr >> Dayr az Azwr, Khoramabad >> Khorramabad, 
            Shahr E Kord >> Shar e Kord, Zagizig >> Zagazig, Damanhr >> Damanhur, 
            Nabatiyet et Tahta >> Nabatiye et Tahta
- CHANGED:  Greeneville, NC should be Greenville, NC
- CHANGED:  Two point features labeled Bayankhongor in Mongolia. Kept the ’southern’ 
            point, delete the northern one. Southern feature featureType changed to 
            “Admin-1 cap”.
